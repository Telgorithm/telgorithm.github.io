Should you verify your Toll Free numbers or consider switching to 10DLC? Here’s what we think.**\n\n![Toll Free Verification Required](toll-free-verification-required.jpg \"Toll Free Verification Required\")\n\n\n\n> **UPDATE (9/13)**: Previously, all Toll-Free numbers provisioned for any messaging use case needed to be registered by September 30, 2022 in order to continue sending traffic. The messaging industry will now allow you to send traffic over unverified Toll-Free numbers if you are sending under a certain threshold.\n>\n> **What is new?** Effective October 1, 2022, the following industry-wide thresholds will apply for messaging sent over unverified Toll-Free numbers in the U.S.:\n>\n> * **Daily Limit: 2,000 messages per day**\n> * **Weekly Limit: 12,000 messages per week**\n> * **Monthly Limit: 25,000 messages per month**\n>\n> These thresholds are subject to change–we will let you know at least 30 days in advance before changes are made.\n\n\n\nOkay folks, it happened – Toll Free verification is officially being **required**. This is a major update for anyone currently using Toll Free business text messaging, particularly if you purchased any Toll Free numbers before May 15, 2022 (numbers purchased after May 15 should have already gone through verification). All Toll Free numbers must be registered no later than Friday, September 30, 2022 in order to prevent blockages. YIKES!\n\nKeep in mind that the verification process can take up to 7 days, so plan ahead. \n\nOur team can help get you verified, no problem. [Reach out today](/contact-us/) to get started! \n\n## Summary of Key Details\n\n* If you purchased any Toll Free numbers before May 15, you are now required to get them verified\n* The verification deadline is Friday, September 30\n* Verification can take up to 7 days to complete\n* Unverified Toll Free numbers will experience blockages after the deadline \n\n## On the other hand… have you considered switching to 10DLC? \n\nWe are happy to get your Toll Free numbers verified right away. However, this could be an ideal time for you to learn more about 10DLC (local numbers) in comparison to Toll Free since you have to take immediate action either way. Here are a few things we want you to know: \n\n1. Toll Free is actually more expensive than 10DLC. That’s right – it costs more to send SMS and MMS messages from Toll Free numbers. \n2. Your Toll Free throughput allotments are the same (and in some cases lower) compared to 10DLC. In other words, you’re paying more for the same or lower throughputs. \n3. Inbound messages are FREE on 10DLC! They’re not on Toll Free. For certain use cases such as 2-way communication, this could result in significant savings for your business. \n\nThere are a lot of misconceptions about 10DLC being unnecessarily complex, but in many cases it’s a better option for businesses, with the advantages of local presence. From a cost standpoint alone, there are a lot of opportunities to save. We’ve streamlined the 10DLC registration process, allowing you to turn up fully compliant numbers within minutes (versus days for Toll Free). \n\n## Join Our Virtual Q&A with The Campaign Registry \n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about 10DLC and registration with The Campaign Registry, we encourage you to join a virtual Q&A with our CEO and Co-founder Aaron Alter and Stefan Heller, the VP of Business Development and Strategic Partnerships at The Campaign Registry, on September 21. Aaron will be asking Stefan some of the most pressing questions our customers and prospects have been asked over the last two years! You can [sign up](https://join.telgorithm.com/qa-with-stefan-heller-0) to attend live or receive the recording directly in your inbox. \n\nWe’re here to help you determine which path is best for your business, so don’t hesitate to [reach out](/contact-us/) with your questions!","excerpt":"Toll Free verification is required starting September 30.
