A2P Phone Numbers from SMS API Provider"},"body":"Porting or migrating active/existing [application-to-person (A2P)](https://www.telgorithm.com/glossary/application-to-person-messaging-a2p/) phone numbers from one SMS API provider to another is called Number Porting. Automated Number Porting is Telgorithm’s way of enabling businesses to port A2P numbers instantly and in bulk, avoiding any customer disruptions.\n\nMigrating, or porting, A2P phone numbers from one API provider to another can be nerve-wracking whether you have dozens of numbers or thousands. When a business tries to use a live phone number during a provider transition, the fear is that when they attempt to send messages, they send an API call to their previous provider which is no longer connected, and nothing comes back.\n\nTelgorithm developed a unique API logic that informs users in real-time the exact moment a number switches from another provider. This feature allows businesses to proactively set up an ‘event’ to automatically send all API calls to the new provider, enabling instant and bulk porting of numbers. Other providers do not have this capability, setting this service apart in the industry.\n\nAdditionally, we do not charge to port numbers – Automated Number Porting is included in our services. Because of our [hosted messaging](https://www.telgorithm.com/glossary/hosted-sms-messaging/) capability, businesses can stay with their current provider for voice services and port just their SMS/MMS to the new provider. This feature allows for concurrent hosting of messaging on the same numbers.\n\nThis approach to number porting not only simplifies the transition process but also ensures continuous communication without interruptions. By leveraging this automated solution, businesses can maintain seamless messaging operations while benefiting from advanced features and real-time updates.\n\nChoosing an automated and real-time solution for A2P number porting enhances efficiency, reliability, and customer satisfaction, ensuring that messaging services remain uninterrupted and fully functional during provider transitions.
