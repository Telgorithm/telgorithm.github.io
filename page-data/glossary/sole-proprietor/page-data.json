These entities, often at the beginning of their business journey, might not have the traditional documentation typically [required for 10DLC registration](https://www.telgorithm.com/news/10dlc-registration-required/). \n\nThis use case enables these entities to participate in [A2P (Application-to-Person) messaging via 10-digit long codes](https://www.telgorithm.com/news/10dlc-registration-required/), allowing them to send SMS and MMS messages to customers, while adhering to specific guidelines set by CTIA and mobile carriers to prevent misuse. \n\nRecognizing the importance of enabling these businesses to communicate with their customers through SMS and MMS, [The Campaign Registry (TCR)](https://www.telgorithm.com/glossary/the-campaign-registry-tcr/) has a simplified registration process tailored to their circumstances.\n\n## Sole Proprietor 10DLC Registration Process\n\nTo participate in 10DLC messaging, sole proprietors must go through a specialized registration process. Unlike larger businesses that are required to submit an [EIN](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online) or Tax ID, sole proprietors provide other forms of verification, such as a valid government-issued ID, along with their name and address. \n\nThis process is designed to be accessible while ensuring that the registrant is genuinely operating as a sole proprietor and not attempting to bypass standard regulatory requirements. Once registered, sole proprietors gain access to 10DLC messaging, which allows them to send A2P messages to their customers. This includes marketing, transactional, and informational messages. \n\nHowever, due to the potential for misuse, these Campaigns are closely monitored, ensuring compliance with guidelines that prevent spam and other abusive practices.\n\n## Benefits for the Sole Proprietor\n\nThe Sole Proprietor Use Case offers several benefits to small businesses and individual entrepreneurs:\n\n**Accessibility** thanks to lower barriers to entry for 10DLC registration, which makes it easier for sole proprietors to access high-quality messaging channels. This accessibility is crucial for those who are in the early stages of business development.\n\n**Effective communication** as a result of sole proprietors being able to connect with their customers reliably and efficiently. Messages sent through 10DLC are less likely to be flagged as spam, ensuring they reach their intended audience.\n\n**Cost-Effective** for businesses with limited resources—10DLC offers an affordable communication channel. The streamlined registration process also reduces upfront costs, allowing sole proprietors to focus on growing their business.\n\n## Telgorithm Supports the Sole Proprietor Use Case\n\nTelgorithm is one of few Connectivity Partners (CNPs) that can fully support customers with proper sole proprietor registration, carrier rate limit management, and reporting, unlocking companies like [Constant Contact](https://www.telgorithm.com/news/constant-contact-telgorithm-partnership/) and others to provide this solution to their sole proprietor users.  \n\nOur [Smart Queueing ](https://www.telgorithm.com/smart-queueing/)technology automates carrier rate limit management, and has been approved by TCR as a solution to sole proprietor rate requirements.
